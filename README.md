# Mini-NoClip
Extremely small (1kb!) and portable noclip hack for the game Geometry Dash, wrote in x86 intel assembly.

No dependencies; just download, compile and run. Should support Windows XP+.

## Improvements
Code is really bloated and can be definitely shortened. Moreover, some unused values of the PE could be abused to save even more space, but i haven't tried.

## Credits
Big thanks to [MgostIH](https://github.com/MgostIH) for the hash code and the byte patch.
